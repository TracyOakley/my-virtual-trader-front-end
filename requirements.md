### Software Requirements

What is the vision of this product?

+ To create a stock trading app that users may trade securities with no personal risk. 

What pain point does this project solve?

+ Losing money in the stock market due to not practicing trading with fake money first. 

Why should we care about your product?

+ You should care if you are looking to get into securities trading, but want to do so in an environment that will allow you to practice on live stocks, with fake money. Hone your skills, in order to be a master trader, when you use your real, hard earned money. 

### Scope In()

### Scope Out()

### MVP

+ Add stocks or crypto to your watchlist. Purchase stocks or crypto with paper money, and track changes to the current balance of your portfolio. 

Stretch Goals

+ Search functionality, to be able to look up any stock listed on the NYSE as well as crypto, instead of the dropdown box, with a predetermined list of securities. 

### Non Functional Requirements. 

+ Security with Auth0. Users will be able to securely log into their account with Auth0. This will allow only access to the user, and ensure that only they are able to make changes to their accounts. This is only a paper trading app, but we still want users to have security to simulate an actual account. 
+ Usability. Learnability. The app will be very simple and easy to learn. It will also be satisfactory, and a rewarding experience. This will make users want to use the app, and to come back and continue to use it.
